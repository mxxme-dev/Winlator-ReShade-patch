## V1 - Winlator ReShade Installer // Injector Method üõ†Ô∏è

For those who prefer a more hands-on approach or for reference, here's how the original V1 worked.

### How to Use:  
1.  **Download the `.7z`**: Grab the Archive from the [releases page](https://github.com/mxxme-dev/Winlator-ReShade-patch/releases/download/reshade-winlator-patches/ReShade.Winlator-Mxxme.Jhinzuo.7z) .
2.  **Edit `cfg_game.txt`**: Open the `cfg_game.txt` file using Notepad inside the Container.
    **Do not change it with any other Text-Editor !**
4.  **Configure Game Entry**: The file's content should follow this format:
    ```bash
    game.exe;64/32
    ```
    * Replace `game.exe` with the actual executable name of your game.
    * Specify `64` or `32` depending on whether your game is 64-bit or 32-bit.

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    BALDI.exe;64
    ```
